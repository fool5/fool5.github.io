**Hello MarkDown！**

#### yping commands on the command line is a kind of **Geek** behavior, which I find quite interesting.

Geek is a transliteration of the American slang Geek phonetic symbol [ɡiːk]. With the rise of Internet culture, this term has the meaning of superior intelligence and hard work, and has been used to describe people who have a fanatical interest in computer and network technology and devote a lot of time to research.
Although the meaning of modern Geek is different from the past, most of them are still similar. Geek refers to people who create new business models, cutting-edge technologies and fashion trends in the Internet era.

Interesting, the following gif can express my feelings:
